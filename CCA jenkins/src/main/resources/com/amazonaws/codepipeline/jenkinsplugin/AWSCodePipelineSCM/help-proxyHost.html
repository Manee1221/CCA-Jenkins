  <p>You might need a proxy host address if you are hosting Jenkins on a private network.
    The proxy name can be an IP address or DNS address. The AWS CodePipeline Plugin for Jenkins requires internet access.
    If access is not configured, you might see errors in the AWS CodePipeline Polling Log.</p>
